1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,680
The walls gave the people
a century of peace and security.

2
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,770
The terror of being at their mercy

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,000
and the humiliation of being
trapped became a distant memory.

4
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,930
Until...

5
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,040
The battle for humanity's survival

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,820
began the moment the
Titans breached the wall.

7
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:04,880
After innumerable casualties
among soldiers and civilians alike,

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,960
it was learned that some Titans
were hiding among the humans.

9
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,550
Finally, five years after
the first wall fell,

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,720
humans succeeded in capturing one of
these disguised Titans: Annie Leonhart.

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
The existence of the Wall Titans

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,440
had been kept secret by the Wall Priests

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,800
whereof one of them
was questioned by Hange ZoÃ«.

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,840
In the end, the priest still kept quiet.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,140
Tell me, Pastor Nick...

16
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,640
Are <i>all</i> the walls made of Titans?

17
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,480
Nevertheless...

18
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,150
...the next threat to humanity
was already close at hand.

19
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,500
Hurry! Inform Commander Erwin!

20
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,220
Hurry!

21
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,130
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!

22
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,720
"12 hours earlier"
"South of Wall Sina"

23
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,660
Miche?

24
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,170
Tomas! Take three couriers and go!

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,910
I hear thuds! They sound like footsteps!

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,950
What are you talking about, Sasha?

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,460
It's the truth! I really hear footsteps!

28
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,260
Nanaba?

29
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,930
Everyone here?

30
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,260
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.

31
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,930
They're coming right this way.

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
There's no time for you to gear up.

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,220
Take your horses and evacuate
all nearby homes and settlements.

34
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,350
Understood?

35
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,840
From... the south?

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,460
<i>Has</i> the wall been breached?!

37
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,840
As soon as the Titans reach the woods,

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,170
we'll split into teams
of recruits and soldiers alike,

39
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,820
and then simultaneously scatter
in each direction!

40
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,130
Avoid combat when possible
and focus on getting the word out!

41
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,750
Is anyone familiar with this region?!

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,370
M-Me!

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,800
And... so is Conny!

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,710
My village is to the south...

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,280
...where the Titans are coming from.

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,060
I can take you to the nearby
villages. After that...

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,020
...please let me visit mine.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,020
All right.

49
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,100
You'll guide the southern team.

50
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,020
Yes, Sir!

51
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,970
The Titans have reached the woods!

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,440
Scatter!

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,000
Ride as fast as you can!

54
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,880
What?!

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,570
They all started sprinting!

56
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,510
Whoa! They're going to catch up!

57
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,110
Gelgar!

58
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,350
Take charge of the southern team!

59
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,240
Sir?!

60
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
He won't survive! I'll help!

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,640
No! We can't spare anyone else!

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Have faith in him!

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,370
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,330
Commander Pyxis!

65
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,880
Titans have been spotted!

66
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,110
Wall Rose has been breached!

67
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,240
Ugh. Those damn Titans never give us a break.

68
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,480
Can you go?

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,310
Not like there's much choice.

70
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,550
It was wise to have
Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.

71
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,530
I believe he can handle the situation.

72
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,080
Yes.

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,570
Let's hope so.

74
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,150
Four left.

75
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,280
No, it's time to go.

76
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,970
I've bought enough time.

77
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,310
Still...

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,400
...I <i>am</i> concerned about that Abnormal.

79
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,170
It's huge...

80
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,910
And I've never seen
a Titan covered in fur before.

81
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,530
Great! You're back!

82
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,860
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.

83
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,950
It went for the horse?!

84
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,020
You can't be serious!

85
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,950
Wait.

86
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,910
Huh? Didn't I just say to wait?

87
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,080
Tell me, what is that weapon called?

88
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,970
That thing on your waist that flies around.

89
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,970
I'm certain we speak the same language.

90
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,910
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.

91
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,530
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.

92
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,820
As long as we continue to fight...

93
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,400
...we are not beaten!

94
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,660
You can move now.

95
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,460
No! No!

96
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,800
Stop! Don't! No! No!

97
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,210
No!

98
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,510
So you <i>can</i> speak.

99
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,220
I must say, what a clever idea.

100
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,270
No! No!

101
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,650
Stop! No!

103
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,680
Oh, Eren.

104
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,570
Did you get into <i>another</i> fight?

105
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,060
Those jerks started it! They made fun of me!

106
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,620
So, I assume Mikasa had to
come to your rescue again?

107
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,600
Thanks.

108
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,240
Eren.

109
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,370
No matter how cruel someone is
or how much you hate them,

110
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,820
you can't always charge at them head-on!

111
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,130
You're a man!

112
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,640
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,750
That's...

114
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,710
It fell.

115
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,750
You gotta be tired. Go get some sleep.

116
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,750
Sorry. I'm fine.

117
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,730
That thing's seen better days.

118
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll get you a new one
if I see any in our supplies.

119
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,660
Eren! Mikasa!

120
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,460
This is really bad!

121
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,920

There could be Titans anywhere!

127
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,080
Get back here, Conny!

128
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,420
This can't be...

129
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,950
Anyone?! Is anyone there?!

130
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,930
It's me! Conny!

131
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,820

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,950
The Titan...

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't know how, but...

142
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,970
Fall back, you two!

143
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,970
I'll scout the area!

Wait, it's...

145
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,220
It can't move?

146
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220

Damn it!

157
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,880
Would Titans break walls with Titans in them?

158
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,950
It's happened before.
They busted the wall into our city.

159
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,370
That was a gate.

160
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,150
Armin? What are you saying?

161
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,150
The thing about the walls...

162
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,880
There's no crevices between the rocks
or any signs of cracking.

163
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,440
We can't really tell how they're made.

164
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,930
So what if they're made
of hardened Titan skin?

165
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,730
Titans... in the wall...

166
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,280
Eren. Wear it right.

167
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
It's cold at night.

Sorry to keep ya!

169
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,000
Took longer to prepare than we thought.

170
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,880
Um...

171
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,170
Isn't this a priest from
the Order of the Walls?

172
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,600
Yeah. Nick and I are best buddies.

173
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,820
Right?

174
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,820
Don't let him bother you.

175
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,040
The whole makeup of this squad
doesn't make any sense.

176
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Does it, Levi?

177
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,770
No, I think it might.

178
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,150
Erwin picked them out for a reason.

179
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,770
Open the gate!

180
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,530
The situation within Wall Rose is unclear.

181
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,640
But everything up until Ehrmich is safe.

182
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,860
We'll save time going through there.

183
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Move out!

184
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,330
Yes, sir!

185
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,770
Take us out.

186
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,660
Yes, sir!

187
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,260
Huh? He knew?

188
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,640
There's Titans inside the walls
and he's known about it?!

189
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Yes, though...

190
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,220
...he's kept his mouth shut this entire time.

191
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,840
But now he's coming with us
to witness the harsh reality.

192
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,800
Will his beliefs be strong enough
for him to stay silent?

193
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,240
Or will seeing it with his own eyes
make him question himself?

194
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,680
No, no, no, no! This is all backwards!

195
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,520
If there's something you
know, tell us about it!

196
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,220
Nothing's more important than
keeping humans from going extinct!

197
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,920
Eren, settle down.

198
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,750
You're still not fully healed.

199
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,120
There's more than one way to get answers.

200
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,750
I may be injured and useless right now,
but it doesn't take much to watch one man.

201
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,870
I'm hoping we can settle this
without blasting a hole in anyone.

202
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,300
Aren't you?

203
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,470
Threatening him doesn't work, Levi.

204
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,470
Believe me, I've tried.

205
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,970
It seems to me that this priest
is capable of sound judgment.

206
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,150
That's why I wonder...

207
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,450
What if the reason he doesn't talk

208
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,720
is because he knows something more
important than the fate of humanity?

209
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,730
"Ehrmich District"

210
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,550
Hey, keep moving.

211
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,200
You'll end up like a little lost kid.

212
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Th-This is...

213
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,650
What did you expect you'd see?

214
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,220
This is what happens when the wall falls.

215
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,770
Mommy! Daddy!

216
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,450
Looks like someone was here recently.

217
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,520
Some bandits probably used it as a base.

218
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,000
It said "Ruins of Utgard Castle"
on one of the signs.

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,750
You, the Southern Team, met us
after having followed the wall

220
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,820
and couldn't find a hole anywhere.

221
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,470
Yeah. We'll have to check again tomorrow.

222
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,450
You rookies should try to get some rest.

223
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,700
Titans won't be roaming around at this hour,

224
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,950
but the rest of us will
take turns keeping watch.

225
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,710
We'll leave from here
four hours before daybreak.

226
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,050
Um...

227
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,370
If the wall weren't to be destroyed

228
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,220
the Titans... Where could
they be invading from?

229
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm just saying, but...

230
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,670
Yeah... There's barely
any Titans around here.

231
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,220
If the wall was really broken, that is.

232
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,170
Finding the answer to that...
is our job for tomorrow.

233
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,620
Pastor Nick! Have you had a change of heart yet?

234
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,400
We don't have time for this!
You know, don't you?!

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,650
Will you talk, or won't you?!
Make up your mind already!

236
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,620
I cannot say anything.

237
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,370
The other believers are the same as I,
and that will never change.

238
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,370
Well thanks for nothing!

239
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,750
We're so grateful for all
the help you've been!

240
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,320
It's too great a decision
for a single person to make.

241
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,440
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

242
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
--This way.
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

243
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,990
-Sir! Thank you!
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

244
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,990
Whose will?

245
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,350
God or something?

246
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,670
I cannot say anything.

247
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,820
However,

248
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:54,170
I can inform you of a name, who under the
sacred will, we were instructed to monitor.

249
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,370
Monitor?

250
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,450
That person joined the Scout
Regiment as of this year.

251
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,920
Their name is...

252
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,400
Excuse me!

253
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,670
104th Cadet Corps!

254
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,950
Sasha Braus!

255
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,100
Her?

256
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,450
Who's that?

257
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,250
Um, this is for you, Section Commander.

258
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,720
You must find her at once.

259
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,070
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

260
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,370
That is all the information I can share.

261
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,270
The rest I leave in your hands.

262
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,620
If she's in the 104th, then she's deep
in the front lines right now.

263
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Let's go!

264
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,850
We need to hurry!

265
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,150
Wait!

266
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,250
Ouch...

267
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,020
Sasha?!

268
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
What are you doing here?

269
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,700
Upon my arrival, I gave my report
to the Commander!

270
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,230
Afterwards, I was entrusted to deliver
this message to the Section Commander!

271
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,050
Message? Thank you. Good work.

272
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,850
So, who is this girl in the 104th?

273
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,300
She's the smallest one of us.

274
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,650
She's got long golden hair.

275
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,270
Um, and...

276
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,720
She's cute.

277
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,900
She's always hanging around Ymir.

278
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,700
"Ymir"?

279
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,670
Ymir? What are you doing?

280
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,120
Prowling at night, Reiner? Come to see me?

281
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,350
I thought I'd use this time to scavenge
for something that might fill my stomach.

282
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,200
This'll probably end up being my last meal.

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,870
This might do the trick.

284
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,050
Not that I like herring, but--

285
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,050
Is there any more?

286
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,100
Could I see it?

287
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,500
Go for it.

288
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,270
Canned food, huh?

289
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,400
What... are these letters?

290
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,850
I can't read any of it.

291
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,600
This says "herring" on it?

292
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,450
You... are... able to read this language?

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,720
Ymir...

294
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
You're...

295
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,370
Everyone, wake up!

296
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,120
Get to the tower! Quickly!

297
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,970
I couldn't see them in the darkness,
but then the moon...

298
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,550
Why? Why can they move?

299
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,800
It's been so long since the sun set!

300
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,920
What's going on here?

301
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,020
Hey! Look at that!

302
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,820
It's huge! What the hell is it? A Titan?

303
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,270
No, it's more like...

304
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,700
It's like a beast!

305
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,900
Right?

306
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,470
It's... climbing up for the wall!

307
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,000
Stand back, rookies.

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Leave it to us.

309
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,800
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

310
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,420
Let's go!

311
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,150
Get your damn hands away from me!

312
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,150
You piece of shit!

313
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,070
Dumb-asses.

314
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,850
That was way too reckless!

315
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,750
Couldn't you have avoided that
without wasting your blades?

316
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,120
The door is bashed in!

317
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,500
The Titans broke through.

318
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,050
Go back down and form some sort of barricade.

319
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,900
We've all gotta do what we're trained to do.

320
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Give it all we've got till we die!

321
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Understand?

322
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,900
Got it!

323
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,450
I'll go see how far they've come through!

324
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,670
You guys grab boards or rods or whatever!

325
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Bring everything you can carry!

326
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,570
Reiner!

327
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,100
Hey!

328
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,700
Wait up, Reiner! Hold on!

329
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,600
Who does he think he is,
always taking the most dangerous job?

330
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,650
Come on, man!

331
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,320
Yeah, that's a bad habit of his.

332
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,720
They're still below.

333
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,870
They're here!

334
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,250
Bring something, quick!

335
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,200
Reiner!

336
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,020
Reiner! Are you okay?!

337
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,120
Yeah!

338
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,700
Bertholdt, we're gonna survive and go home.

339
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,950
We're going back to our hometown for sure.

340
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,400
Right... Right!

341
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,120
We're going home!

342
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Reiner! Bertholdt!

343
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,770
Out of the way!

344
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,300
Looks like that worked out, miraculously.

345
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,470
What now? Should I cut off its nape?

346
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,000
Don't even try.

347
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,970
You'll get hurt if it grabs you.

348
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,770
F-For now, let's retreat back upstairs.

349
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,970
There could be more
than just one that got inside.

350
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,720
Conny!

351
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,300
Reiner!

352
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,750
Uh, Reiner...

353
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,270
Don't tell me...

354
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,950
You're gonna jump out the window with it?!

355
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,820
I've got no other choice!

356
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,870
Wait!

357
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,000
If I can just slice open its jaw...

358
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,050
You're free!

359
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,470
Sorry... I'm sorry.

360
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,150
I think it's broken.

361
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,920
Yeah, just my luck.

362
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,400
I know.

363
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,450
Sorry...

364
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,870
All I've got is this dirty cloth.

365
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,720
Sorry.

366
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,300
No, it helps.

367
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,750
Gotta marry her.

368
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,200
Everyone understand?

369
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes!

370
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,870
We're going our own ways now.

371
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,570
The rest is up to you.

372
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,350
Erwin may have thrown together your squad,
but everything's riding on you.

373
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,270
Eren.

374
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,550
Learn how to restrain yourself.

375
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,850
Don't succumb to rage
and lose sight of the goal.

376
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,100
We can't afford another mistake.

377
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,600
Yes, sir!

378
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,920
There's a tower nearby
where we can assess the wall.

379
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,970
It's in an abandoned castle to the southwest.

380
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,420
We'll ride to Utgard Castle.

381
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,670
That's mostly it for the big ones.

382
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,670
It's a good thing we have this tower.

383
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,400
Yeah, we might actually survive.

384
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
We'll go check on the recruits!

385
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,970
Okay.

386
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,200
What's that sound?

387
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,900
The horses!

388
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,570
Huh?

389
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,250
Again?!

390
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,950
What the hell is that sound?!

391
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,470
Lynne! Henning!

392
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,420
What was that?!

393
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,650
It's no use.

394
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,470
They both died instantly.

395
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,620
This can't be...

396
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,820
It's him! The one that
climbed up for the wall!

397
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,800
That Beast Titan did this!

398
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,070
A group of Titans approaching!
More than twice the number from earlier!

399
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,820
What'd you say?!

400
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,250
Their timing is too perfect,
like it's part of some strategy.

401
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,370
I get the feeling they've been
toying with us from the start.

402
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,850
This is bad! My gas is all but gone!

403
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,320
Did I get 'em?

404
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,320
This tower won't hold much longer.

405
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
I only have a small amount of gas left.

406
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,320
What about you?

407
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,070
No gas here, and I used up all of my blades.

408
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,550
Those blunt ones the last you have left?

409
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,320
Yeah...

410
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,000
How many did the four of us kill?

411
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,220
I don't know. I didn't
have the luxury to count.

412
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,400
You know what? I think I did
a pretty good job myself.

413
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,120
But the thing is...

414
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,670
I wish I could have a drink before I go.

415
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,370
Gelgar...

416
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,250
Sorry, Nanaba.

417
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,200
I must've hit my head...

418
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,700
I can't hold...

419
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,400
...any longer.

420
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,870
Gelgar!

421
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,500
Gelgar!

422
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,000
No! No!

423
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,770
Father, stop!

424
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,500
Father! I'm sorry!

425
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
No!

426
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,900
Damn it all to hell!

427
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,220
Do we gotta wait here now until
the tower falls and we get eaten alive?

428
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,370
This sucks...

429
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,420
We'll be wiped out without
even finishing our mission.

430
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,400
I... want to keep fighting, too.

431
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,050
If only I had some sort of weapon,

432
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,620
then I could fight and die alongside them.

433
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,720
Christa... You're still
saying things like that?

434
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,320
Don't you dare use their deaths.

435
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,850
They didn't die so you'd have
an excuse to get yourself killed.

436
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,720
That's not... That's not what I...

437
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,300
You're not like Conny and the Scouts!

438
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,720
They don't want to die,
but you don't even care.

439
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,470
All you want to do is die in a way
that makes you seem like a hero.

440
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,000
Th-That's not...

441
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,520
Conny.

442
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Give me that knife you had.

443
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,370
Huh? My knife?

444
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,000
Just hand it over.

445
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,300
Fine. Here.

446
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,520
Thanks.

447
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
What do you want it for?

448
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,750
Hmm?

449
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,750
Well, you see...

450
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm going to fight with this.

451
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,620
Ymir... What are you planning?

452
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,750
Who knows? I don't even know myself.

453
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,770
Ymir...

454
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,770
Christa.

455
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,750
You've probably forgotten
all about it by now...

456
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,400
Christa...

457
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,500
Try to remember... that promise we made
training on that snowy mountain.

458
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,670
Promise me.

459
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,870
When I reveal my secret
to everyone, promise me.

460
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,900
Take back your old name and live.

461
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,470
Remember our promise, Christa.

462
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,750
Ymir! Wait!

463
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,570
Ymir!

464
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,750
Th-That Titan is...

465
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,750
...from that day...

466
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,850
Th-Thanks, Reiner.

467
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,320
Ow, it hurts! Reiner, my leg!

468
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Reiner! That's enough!

469
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,920
Let her leg go! Her leg!

470
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,750
Hey!

471
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,750
S-Sorry.

472
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,950
No, you saved me.

473
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,100
Christa... Did you know?

474
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,870
That Ymir is a Titan?

475
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,920
I had no idea.

476
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,300
I was always so close to her, too.

477
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,270
How? How could this be?

478
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,770
In other words, she knew
some of the secrets of our world.

479
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,850
I wonder... What could be Ymir's goal?

480
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,700
Ymir!

481
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,850
She's--

482
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,650
Wh-What was that?

483
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,120
Is she worried about the tower falling?

484
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,400
She has to be.

485
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,050
If she wanted to,

486
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,700
Ymir could use this power
of hers to escape all on her own.

487
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,500
And yet, she's not doing that.

488
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,750
Don't you die, Ymir!

489
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,320
Don't pretend like you're good, you idiot!

490
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,440
You wanna go out in a blaze of glory?
Are you stupid?!

491
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,270
Live for yourself, goddammit!

492
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,170
If you're gonna die protecting
this tower, forget about it!

493
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,520
Tear it down!

494
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,670
Hey!

495
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,270
H-Hey! She's really tearing it down!

496
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,270
Keep it up, Ymir!

497
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,620
Want live...?

498
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,020
Grab me!

499
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,800
Titans again?

500
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,970
Hey, ugly! Go and finish the job!

501
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,020
Ymir!

502
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,720
This looks bad.

503
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,820
Ymir is...

504
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,670
This can't...

505
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,170
This can't...

506
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,070
Christa!

507
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,300
This can't...

508
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,550
Ymir, wait!

509
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,120
I still...

510
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,520
...want to talk to you!

511
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,350
I still--

512
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,250
I still haven't told you my real name!

513
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,520
Wait...

514
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,020
I still...

515
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,270
Christa. Everyone, get back.

516
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,000
We've got this.

517
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,220
Leave the rest to us.

518
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,300
Mikasa!

519
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,070
Have the others disperse and cover the area!

520
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,470
The rest of us will attack
where the Titans are gathering!

521
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,150
Got it!

522
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,970
Hey!

523
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,570
We don't need you to be a part of the attack!

524
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,300
Die!

525
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,020
I did it! My first kill!

526
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,620
You moron! I told you to stay back, Eren!

527
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Right! I'm sorry!

528
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,120
Ouch...

529
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,370
Hey!

530
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,000
Eren!

531
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,500
You guys!

532
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,470
It can't be...

533
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,100
Ymir is...

534
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,750
Ymir...

535
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,170
My real name...

536
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,620
...is Historia.

537
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,250
Reiner! Grab on!

538
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,300
Right!

539
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,000
How's Ymir?

540
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,700
She's still in a coma.

541
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,020
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think
steam is coming out of her wounds.

542
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,700
For now, take her back to Trost
so she can get some proper medical care.

543
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,870
She's in your hands.

544
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,920
Understood.

545
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,920
Now then...

546
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,600
Damn, it hurts.

547
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,100
You all right, Reiner?

548
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,320
Not by a long shot.

549
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,050
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.

550
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,800
That was... pathetic.

551
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I thought I was done for.

552
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,850
Even someone as strong as you
gets this way sometimes.

553
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,270
What are you talking about?
This is the second time for me!

554
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,470
Right, Armin?

555
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,320
Huh?

556
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,950
Remember the time I almost
got crushed in that Titan's hand?

557
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,970
Oh...

558
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,570
That makes twice I've nearly died.

559
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:47,150
At this rate, I'll be dead before I know it.

560
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,970
I picked this path on my own,
but being a soldier is rough.

561
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,270
It's like a soldier's spirit
breaks down before their body.

562
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,620
Though, until we plug up this wall,

563
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,670
there's no time to waste whining about it.

564
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,770
Yeah.

565
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,200
You two have been driven
far enough away from your hometown.

566
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,420
I'm thinking... this is where
we gotta draw the line.

567
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,920
I'm thinking... this is where
we gotta draw the line.

568
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,700
Our hometown! Let's return!

569
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,500
Isn't it about time to go back?

570
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,470
Compared to all the trouble we've
been through, what's left to do is nothing!

571
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,950
That's right.

572
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,850
We're so close, it's just
another few steps till the end.

573
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,570
Huh?

574
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,400
What are you guys talking about?

575
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,670
Thanks, Mikasa.

576
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,500
Are you hurt?

577
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,550
I'm fine, but... Reiner got his arm bit
and Ymir is as you can see.

578
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,100
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?

579
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,120
Sasha.

580
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,570
Is everyone clear?

581
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,370
We'll deal with Ymir later.

582
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:01,420
For the time being, I want you to focus
on the mission to fix the wall.

583
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,000
Hannes?

584
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,600
It's the Garrison's advance squad.

585
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,800
They came to tell us where the hole is.

586
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,200
There's no hole anywhere!

587
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,700
Huh?

588
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,300
We spent all night looking for it...

589
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,320
...but at least between Trost and Krolva District,
there's nothing wrong with the wall.

590
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,570
What'd you say?

591
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,500
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva
and retraced our steps.

592
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,470
We haven't seen any Titans
the whole way here.

593
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,500
But... we know for sure there's Titans
on this side of the wall.

594
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,000
Did you actually look?
Are you sure you're not drunk?

595
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,320
I didn't drink!

596
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?

597
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,050
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.

598
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,400
For now, we're falling
back to Trost District!

599
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,100
You guys aren't completely safe just yet.

600
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,670
Don't let your guard down.

601
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,700
There's nothing wrong with the wall?

602
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,820
What could this mean?

603
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,550
There's been nothing like this in five years.
Why is it all happening now?

604
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,570
This world is getting more
and more out of hand.

605
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,350
Eren.

606
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,650
Have a minute?

607
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,920
We need to talk.

608
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,350
What about?

609
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:41,570
Five years ago, we demolished the wall
and began our attack on humanity.

610
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:46,050
Oh no... What if there's a Titan
that dug a hole underneath the wall?

611
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,020
The hole will be hard to find in that case.

612
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,400
I'm the Armored Titan
and he's the Colossal Titan.

613
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,450
Right now, we need to focus
on getting Ymir back safely.

614
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,400
Even with our horses,
we still have to worry about Titans.

615
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,750
Huh?

616
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,200
What are you talking about?

617
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,520
Why are you telling him, Reiner?

618
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,200
Our primary goal was to ensure
all of humanity was wiped out,

619
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,600
but now there's no need for that.

620
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,350
Uh...

621
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,770
Eren.

622
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:21,600
If you agree to come with us, we won't
have to destroy any more of the walls.

623
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,800
Understand?

624
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,620
Huh?

625
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,500
No, wait! I don't understand at all!

626
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,600
I'm saying... Why don't
you just come with us?

627
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,220
Hey! We're leaving!

628
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,120
What the hell?

629
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:43,020
And here I thought I had
enough to think about yesterday...

630
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,900
"12 hours earlier"

631
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:48,920
"Ehrmich District"

632
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Eh?
"Ehrmich District"

633
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,280
What is it, Section Commander?
"Ehrmich District"

634
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:51,950
What is it, Section Commander?

635
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,820
Oh, well...

636
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,750
I was finally able to get my hands on
the background report for Annie Leonhart.

637
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,820
According to this,

638
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,420
there were two others belonging
to the 104th Cadet Corps

639
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,070
who came from the same area as her.

640
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,950
And those two are...

641
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,970
...Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.

642
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,570
Thanks to the chaos five years ago,

643
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:23,000
pretty much all of their family records are spotty or missing.

644
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,670
However...

645
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,250
During the long-range scouting formation,
their unit was given false information.

646
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,800
They were among those purposely told
that Eren was in the right wing.

647
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,770
The Female Titan attacked
from the right wing!

648
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,850
Huh? What does that mean?

649
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,120
That it's possible they passed on
that information to Annie...

650
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,920
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.

651
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,720
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.

652
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,850
Reiner is like everyone's big brother,
and he's not devious enough to deceive all of us--

653
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,200
I know, Eren.

654
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,820
By itself, that's not
enough to prove anything.

655
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,950
Everyone, listen up.

656
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,800
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt,

657
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,550
act in such a way as to not reveal any suspicions.

658
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,720
Of course, do not make any mention
of Annie Leonhart either.

659
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,550
Regardless if they're
Annie's accomplices or not,

660
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,670
we need to lead them
deep underground and confine them.

661
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,350
Does everyone understand?

662
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,170
Yes!

663
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,170
What the hell?

664
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,350
You're just tired, aren't you?

665
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,550
Right, Bertholdt?

666
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,500
You've been through so much,
it's making you crazy.

667
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,350
Y-Yeah.

668
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,200
Reiner's just really tired.

669
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:43,120
Besides, if you were really the Armored Titan
that killed so many people...

670
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,750
...why would you be asking me
this in the first place?

671
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:51,700
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?

672
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,370
Oh, right.

673
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,570
That's right.

674
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,270
What the hell was I thinking?

675
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,870
Have I really gone crazy?

676
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,050
Come on, let's go.

677
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,250
I see...

678
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,700
That's it.

679
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,770
I've been here too long for my own good.

680
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,570
It's been three long years...

681
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,650
surrounded by nothing but idiots.

682
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:12,120
We were just kids... We didn't know anything.

683
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,200
If only I never knew that
there were people like this...

684
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
I...

685
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,250
...wouldn't have become...

686
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,220
...such a half-assed piece of shit!

687
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:33,100
It's too late now...
I don't know what's right anymore.

688
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,700
But the only choice for me now...

689
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,750
...is to face the consequences
of my actions...

690
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,770
...and as a warrior...

691
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,020
...fulfill my duty to the bitter end!

692
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,720
Reiner!

693
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,050
Are we doing it?! Now?! Right here?!

694
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,100
Yeah.

695
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,300
We settle this... right here, right now!

696
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,220
Eren!

697
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,270
Run!

698
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,670
Bertholdt!

699
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,950
Eren! Get out of there!

700
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,950
Eren!

701
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,890
I'm going to return to my hometown.

702
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,770
That's all I care about now.

703
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,600
Bertholdt...

704
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,500
Reiner...

705
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,000
You damn traitors!

706
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,100
Eren!

707
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,300
Everyone, jump away from the wall!

708
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,170
It got Ymir!

709
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,300
And somebody else, too!

710
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,200
All soldiers, prepare to attack!

711
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,670
We're taking down the Colossal Titan!

712
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,620
It's a threat to all of humanity!

713
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,620
Swarm the huge bastard!

714
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,550
Just like the reports said, he's slow!

715
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,520
It might be big, but that's it!

716
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,050
Compared to the Titans we
normally fight, this'll be easy!

717
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,620
Now's our chance! Slice up his neck!

718
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,100
Too hot!

719
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,450
Everyone, fall back!

720
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,700
He's trying to disappear again?

721
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,200
No, something is different.

722
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
The last time he vanished instantly,

723
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:11,420
but now, he's maintaining his form
and emitting heat like a furnace.

724
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,900
If he keeps protecting himself with steam...

725
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,270
We're unable to attack him with ODM gear!

726
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,200
Wh-What do we do?!

727
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,250
We can't do anything. We wait.

728
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,100
It's yet to be seen how long
he can keep his body burning, but...

729
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,800
...eventually he has to come out.

730
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,820
We wait for that moment to attack.

731
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,600
Listen up.

732
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,520
Forget about capturing them.

733
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,970
Kill 'em...

734
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,020
...and don't hesitate!

735
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,100
Armin... and squad one follow me!

736
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,150
We've got a date with the Armored Titan!

737
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,050
That did nothing!

738
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,670
Eren's attack didn't...

739
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,670
And my blades don't work either?!

740
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,170
What's worse, unlike Annie,
his whole body is hard!

741
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,420
Eren!

742
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,900
Hey, Reiner...

743
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:39,420
I don't know what kind of face
you're making right now, but...

744
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,520
You guys... You really are
the worst pieces of shit.

745
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,400
What the hell are you thinking?

746
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,850
I've never felt so revolted before.

747
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,350
Just remembering you and
your self-righteous face is making me sick.

748
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:08,550
It makes me want to vomit.
You... big damn pest!

749
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,820
It's time to exterminate you!

750
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,050
He threw the Armored Titan!

751
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,150
Wait... Isn't that...

752
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,150
...the technique Annie used?

753
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,070
It's working! I've got him now!

754
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,170
I still have a chance!

755
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,750
Think again!

756
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,120
Eren!

757
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,700
You're not getting away from this!

758
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,020
He did it!

759
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,570
Eren! Can you hear me?!

760
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,550
Run away! Get closer to the wall!

761
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,300
Their goal is to kidnap and take you away!

762
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,570
We've gotta escape and
prevent that from happening!

763
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:51,770
But, Armin, Reiner isn't going to
let us do as we please!

764
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,120
It's dangerous here! Get back, you two!

765
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,900
Huh?

766
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,870
Huh?

767
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,820
Nice, Eren! Good call!

768
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,020
Mikasa!

769
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,620
Use these. It's the rest of my blades.

770
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,650
He's fast!

771
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,270
Shit!

772
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,870
Leg! His leg!

773
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,270
Don't stay on the ground! Eren!

774
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,170
Stand up!

775
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,870
Since I'll get knocked over anyways...

776
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,050
Bring it!

777
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,570
Gimme that neck!

778
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,950
You're mine!

779
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,170
I've got 'em! Now it's a battle of strength!

780
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,330
This freak...

781
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,750
Not enough!

782
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,770
Mikasa!

783
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,000
She cut him!

784
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,870
He can't fight back as much anymore!

785
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,150
You've got this!

786
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,300
Go for it, Eren!

787
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,900
Tear the head off his neck!

788
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,620
Pull the traitor outta there!

789
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,670
I can win!

790
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:17,950
Against Reiner... I can win!

791
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,120
Wh-What the--?

792
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Heh, it's useless.

793
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,250
Keep at it! Don't let up!

794
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,470
He stopped...

795
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,850
But why there?

796
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,450
Be on your guard!

797
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,020
He's calling in Titans!

798
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,950
No other Titans spotted in the area!

799
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,370
What a useless struggle.

800
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,750
Try screaming for help with
your head ripped off, you idiot!

801
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,920
Look, he's tearing it off!

802
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,900
What's with the Armored Titan?

803
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,300
Why'd he scream like that?

804
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,020
Hey...

805
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

806
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,720
Above you! Look out!

807
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,210
"Trost District"

808
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,750
Commander.

809
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:29,650
Wake up, Commander Pyxis.

810
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,800
You'll get sick if you fall asleep here.

811
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,870
I can't believe you drank all this.

812
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:39,250
You're not young anymore.

813
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:43,200
And I'd rather not spend my days
changing your diapers.

814
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,220
Being cared for by a pretty lady
sounds all right to me.

815
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,020
So? What's the situation?

816
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,920
Patrols were sent out once the Titans

817
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,720
were gone from the 1st and 2nd defensive lines,

818
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,000
but any Titan sightings are few and far between.

819
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,570
Hmm...

820
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:05,650
If Hannes and the advance squad
followed the wall without problem,

821
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,900
they'll be returning any minute now.

822
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,970
Commander Pyxis.

823
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,450
Hmm?

824
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,620
Oh. If it isn't Erwin.

825
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,750
I hear you've captured
one of those troublesome mice.

826
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,000
Yes.

827
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,800
Unfortunately, we were one step behind.

828
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,850
Hmm...

829
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:29,870
But at least it will get those goons
in the interior thinking.

830
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:35,290
Maybe they'll reconsider how important
their stale beliefs and motives are to them.

831
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:38,270
Yes, it appears they have.

832
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:39,900
Look over there.

833
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,750
The Military Police have finally been
forced into an area with Titans.

834
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,550
Can you believe it?
I thought this was an emergency.

835
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,470
Yeah. And everyone's just sitting around here.

836
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:56,700
Hey, Levi. Where you hiding the Titans at?

837
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,150
Oh? You all seem so disappointed.

838
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,620
Sorry... A shame you couldn't fight Titans today.

839
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,670
If you're looking for another chance,

840
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,470
there's plenty of expeditions outside the walls.

841
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,100
How about we join forces
and face some Titans together?

842
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,020
A soldier from the front is here!

843
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,220
Inform Commander Pixis!

844
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,570
Mikasa?

845
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,120
Armin! Where's Eren?!

846
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,420
Mikasa, calm down!

847
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,500
You shouldn't be moving!

848
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,100
We don't know how badly you're injured!

849
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,200
Where is he?!

850
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,050
Eren was taken away.

851
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,100
Eren, he...

852
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,450
...he lost to the Armored Titan.

853
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,000
Ymir, too, by Bertholdt and Reiner.

854
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,400
It's been five hours since then.

855
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,950
Is anyone...

856
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,950
Is anyone chasing them?

857
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,320
No...

858
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Why not?!

859
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:45,820
All the horses are on the other side of the wall.

860
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,850
In order to rescue Eren,

861
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:54,220
we have to wait for lifts to come so we can move the horses.

862
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,220
There's nothing we can do.

863
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,770
Section Commander Hange and
the other officers are too injured to move.

864
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:06,870
To even send out a small scouting party,
we're going to need more soldiers than this.

865
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,020
Soldiers with experience.

866
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,120
Understand?

867
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,570
Hey, Armin.

868
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,420
Why?

869
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:33,420
Why does Eren always go
somewhere far away from us?

870
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,920
Yeah, now that you mention it...

871
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:43,370
All I want... is to be at his side.

872
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,120
That's all I ask for...

873
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:05,420
Mikasa? So you're up, huh?

874
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:09,270
I bet you're hungry. Here, eat this.

875
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,150
Armin, catch.

876
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:18,400
As usual, field rations are all there is.

877
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,800
Hmm...

878
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,470
Taste neither good nor bad. Same as always.

879
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,620
Speaking of which,
this is the same as always, too.

880
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,270
Ever since the good old days, you two have been there

881
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:42,370
to clean up the mess of that brat.

882
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,050
That's what I call a lousy relationship. Sheesh.

883
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,850
It's a different time and a different place,

884
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:53,420
but you kids are doing the same thing you always have.

885
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,420
That brat isn't
even all that good at fighting.

886
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:04,200
But no matter if he's up against three or five,
he'll charge in all the same.

887
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:09,520
By the time Mikasa or soldiers showed up,
he'd been beaten into a pulp every time.

888
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,670
But you know...

889
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,420
I've never seen him win a fight before,

890
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,970
but I've never seen him get beat
and give up either.

891
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:28,470
Sometimes he's so tenacious
that even I think it's scary.

892
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,870
No matter how many times
he's knocked over, he gets back up.

893
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,000
That's the kinda guy he is.

894
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You think he'll get taken away
without putting up a fight?

895
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,100
Nope. He'll keep resisting
as long as he has strength.

896
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,870
Even more so when he's up against just two.

897
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,600
He'll give 'em hell no matter who he's up against.

898
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
Until you or I show up to help.

899
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,270
That's how Eren's always been.

900
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,800
I loved those good old days.

901
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,900
If you ask Eren, he'd say those days
were nothing more than a false peace.

902
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:17,550
But for me, I'm more than happy
to be a drunk, useless soldier.

903
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,050
If it means getting back to
those plain, ordinary days...

904
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:24,070
...I'll do whatever I have to.

905
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,570
No matter how long it takes to get there.

906
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,220
I'm coming, too.

907
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:37,100
Without you three together again,
I can't bring back the good old days.

908
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,100
They're here!

909
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,420
Hey!

910
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,150
Isn't that...?

911
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,870
Commander Erwin!

912
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,870
And the Military Police!

913
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,320
You made it, Commander Erwin!

914
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,970
Is the situation the same?

915
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:28,870
Yes, sir!

916
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,020
Good.

917
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,020
Deploy the lifts!

918
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,820
Hange?!

919
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,250
Moblit...

920
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,820
G-Gimme a map.

921
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:48,420
It might be a long shot,
but there's a giant forest here.

922
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,800
We should head straight for it.

923
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,550
Why's that?

924
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,050
It's a gamble, but even if they have
the strength to change into Titans,

925
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:00,350
the other Titans outside
the wall might still be a threat.

926
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,070
Especially after all that fighting.

927
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:08,150
They might not be as bad off as Eren,
but I'm sure they're exhausted.

928
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:09,300
Which means...

929
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,520
they'll want to rest somewhere
where Titans are unable to reach them.

930
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,470
At least until nightfall when Titans can't move.

931
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,450
Oh, Eren...

932
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,920
You're awake?

933
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,370
What the hell?!

934
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:04,080
My arms!

935
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,050
I was the one who did that.

936
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,050
I kinda was in a hurry.

937
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:13,420
When I rushed to bite your nape,
I neglected to take your arms into account.

938
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,570
I see...

939
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,770
I... must've lost.

940
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,270
Eren, stop!

941
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,000
Hold your horses, Eren.

942
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,070
Take a good look around us.

943
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,950
We're in the giant forest within Wall Maria.

944
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:39,000
It's not even close to any of the walls.

945
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,700
In other words, we're
deep in Titan territory.

946
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,200
And then you've got these chumps.

947
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,200
Those dirty bastards.

948
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,870
They're the only ones with any ODM gear on.

949
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:54,170
Reiner's wearing gear he took from you.

950
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:58,750
So I don't think changing into a Titan
at this point is going to solve anything.

951
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:03,520
I realize that you're not
going to listen and do as I say.

952
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,220
But like Ymir was saying,
this place is swarming with Titans.

953
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,450
We could beat the shit out
of each other right now,

954
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:14,220
but when we're weak, the other Titans
would just come and eat us.

955
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:20,050
So until nightfall, when the Titans can't move,
we have no choice but to wait here.

956
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:23,800
Whether you try to run and escape from us...

957
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,750
...or don't and we take you away...

958
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,170
...either way, we wait for night.

959
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,420
Reiner.

960
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,100
You got any water?

961
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,570
If I don't get some soon,
I'm going to dry up and die.

962
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,570
Even if it's a matter of life and death,

963
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,820
there's nothing we can
do given our situation.

964
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:09,570
He's completely right...
This situation couldn't be any shittier.

965
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,750
Speaking of which...

966
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,520
Ever since the Titans showed
up yesterday morning,

967
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,370
we've been working our asses off.

968
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:23,250
With nothing to eat or drink
and not even a wink of sleep.

969
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:27,520
Fortunately, the wall
wasn't broken or anything.

970
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,350
So I think we deserve to
take a break for once.

971
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,320
We'll see about getting promoted later.

972
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,000
Reiner...

973
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,050
Actually, we've done plenty enough to deserve it.

974
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:43,250
I think we've performed outstandingly,
considering all we've been put through.

975
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,900
I know soldiers like us are expected
to fulfill their duties, but...

976
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:50,300
I think we've all earned it.

977
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,200
Reiner...

978
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,850
What in the world are you talking about?

979
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,120
What do you mean?

980
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,420
I'm not saying we go demand to be
promoted to captains or anything.

981
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,670
That's... not what I mean.

982
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:10,120
Oh, yeah. Where did you
all get that cannon from?

983
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,670
That really saved my ass.

984
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,200
It's a good thing Christa
helped me after that.

985
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,670
To be honest, I think she has a thing for me.

986
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:19,490
Hey...

987
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,500
Now that I think about it,
Christa has always treated me especially--

988
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,080
Hey!

989
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,800
You bastard... You've gotta be kidding me.

990
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,920
Huh?

991
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,550
What are you so angry about, Eren?

992
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,720
Did I... say something wrong?

993
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,800
If you want to die, just keep talking!

994
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
Hold up, Eren.

995
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,100
This isn't normal, no
matter how you look at it.

996
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,720
Isn't that right, Bertholdt?

997
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:56,220
If you know something,
quit with the silence and come out and say it.

998
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,450
Huh?

999
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,450
Reiner...

1000
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,500
You're not... a soldier, remember?

1001
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,570
You and I...

1002
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,850
...we're warriors.

1003
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,950
Reiner!

1004
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,820
What are you doing?!

1005
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,800
Hey...

1006
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,050
Why...

1007
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,270
...is Marco...

1008
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,270
...getting eaten?

1009
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,800
Right.

1010
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,450
That's... how it is.

1011
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,250
Huh?

1012
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,320
What's he doing?

1013
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,320
I thought it was strange.

1014
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,720
Why would the guy who broke the wall
risk his life to save Conny?

1015
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:14,300
Everything he does is contradictory,
but he doesn't realize it himself.

1016
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,970
No...

1017
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,850
Unable to bear the weight
of his sins, he convinced

1018
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:21,150
himself he was a soldier protecting the wall

1019
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:25,370
to maintain emotional balance
within his own heart.

1020
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,350
And in the end, he believed it.

1021
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:32,550
As a result, his heart was split
and his memories broken.

1022
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,650
This must not be the first time
Reiner's talked and made no sense...

1023
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,500
It's amazing, really.

1024
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,870
For someone excessively honest like you to--

1025
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:41,920
Enough!

1026
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,800
Shut your mouth.

1027
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,550
Sorry about that.

1028
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,070
I might've pried too much.

1029
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,720
You've gotta be kidding me.

1030
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,420
Why are you pretending to be the victim here?

1031
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,520
What's your deal?

1032
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,120
I told you everything...
while you looked at me right in the eyes.

1033
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:13,550
About the day my mother was eaten alive...

1034
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,270
Isn't that right?

1035
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:19,420
Thanks to the piece of wall you kicked
that went flying straight into my house,

1036
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,650
my mother couldn't escape or run away.

1037
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,220
What were you thinking?

1038
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:29,670
What were you thinking when I told you?

1039
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,900
Back then...

1040
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,820
I felt sorry for you.

1041
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,870
Oh...

1042
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:45,900
I see...

1043
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,550
You guys...

1044
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,720
You guys...

1045
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,500
...are neither soldiers nor warriors.

1046
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,720
You're just murderers.

1047
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,290
You're psychotic mass-murderers

1048
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:02,120
who've killed countless innocent people!

1049
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,200
You don't think I know that?!

1050
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,700
I don't need you to point that out to me!

1051
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,300
Then don't pretend to have emotions
like you're one of us!

1052
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,650
You guys aren't even human anymore!

1053
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:15,770
It's you two who've turned
this world into a living hell!

1054
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,550
Does that make you happy, murderers?!

1055
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:21,420
What are you after by calling us murderers?!

1056
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,970
Do you want us to regret it?

1057
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,520
Do you want us to apologize?!

1058
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,000
Would that give you satisfaction?

1059
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:29,000
The people you thought
we were no longer exist!

1060
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,970
If screaming will make you feel better,
then scream your damn head off!

1061
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,120
That's right...

1062
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,350
I'm still...

1063
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,350
...too naÃ¯ve.

1064
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,520
I've...

1065
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,950
...gotta do what I can.

1066
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,550
Do what I can...

1067
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,100
...to make you guys...

1068
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,450
...suffer and die in the worst way possible.

1069
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,820
You've got it coming.

1070
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,000
You can't be serious.

1071
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,300
Huh?

1072
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,100
Quit it, Eren.

1073
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,750
If you keep saying childish crap like that,
I've got no hope for you.

1074
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,300
Huh?!

1075
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,050
Hey, Reiner.

1076
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,350
What's the deal with that monkey?

1077
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,720
Monkey? What do you mean?

1078
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,020
Hmm? You don't know?

1079
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,350
That's surprising, given how much you two

1080
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:49,870
stared at it with stars in your
eyes like two little brats.

1081
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,200
That monkey...

1082
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:55,500
What's "monkey"?

1083
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,820
Just listen.

1084
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:02,670
That monkey Beast Titan
is what caused this recent fiasco.

1085
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,270
It made Titans rise up from within the wall.

1086
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,270
I wonder if he was trying
to assess our strength.

1087
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,350
That's where these guys are trying to get.

1088
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:16,650
You... What do you know?!
Tell me everything!

1089
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:19,850
Just wait. I've got circumstances of my own.

1090
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:22,470
What the hell do you mean by that?!

1091
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:26,170
Eren... if you think killing these two
will bring an end to everything...

1092
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,450
...you're gravely mistaken.

1093
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,300
Huh?!

1094
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:31,520
Then who's the enemy?!

1095
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,550
Enemy?

1096
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,570
If I said that, the w--

1097
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:35,920
Ymir!

1098
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,770
Do you think there's any
future for this world?

1099
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:43,800
If you know so much,
think about what you want to do.

1100
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,250
It's not out of the question
for you to join our side.

1101
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,920
And trust you?

1102
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,450
Yeah, right. You two don't even trust me.

1103
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,020
Wrong. We can trust you.

1104
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:57,850
Because your one goal...

1105
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:01,400
...is to protect Christa.

1106
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:07,150
When it comes to her,
we should be able to trust one another.

1107
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:11,500
If you come with us,
we can't guarantee your safety.

1108
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,900
But if it's Christa we're talking about,
we might be able to do something for her.

1109
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:21,550
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

1110
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,800
It's up to you to decide.

1111
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,470
There's no future for this world?

1112
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:31,300
Why's that? What's "monkey"?

1113
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,300
What's going on?

1114
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,700
Hey!

1115
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,400
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

1116
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,320
Ymir!

1117
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,520
Who knows...

1118
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,700
It's settled then.

1119
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,800
Too bad, Eren.

1120
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,520
You're kidding...

1121
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,370
The Scouts... are already...

1122
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,000
Dammit!

1123
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,300
What's going on, Reiner?

1124
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,070
Aren't we waiting until night?

1125
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:22,820
Nope. We're leaving now.

1126
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:25,500
Eren, don't try to resist.

1127
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,020
Come on, don't get violent with me.

1128
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:35,020
Look at the shape that I'm in.
Does it look like I can resist?

1129
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,520
Please, gimme a break.

1130
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:49,150
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

1131
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,300
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!

1132
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,050
I'll kill you!

1133
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:00,970
Hey. Why are we leaving already?

1134
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,070
Ymir.

1135
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:07,250
When you turned back into a human,
do you remember the person you ate?

1136
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:12,200
No, I don't remember...

1137
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:15,520
But if it was five years ago...

1138
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,050
Was it one of your comrades?

1139
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:23,600
I see...

1140
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,050
Sorry... for not even remembering.

1141
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,100
It's not your fault for forgetting.

1142
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:34,300
It was the same for us, too.

1143
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,470
I see...

1144
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,600
Do you resent me for it?

1145
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:43,270
I'm not sure... I... don't know.

1146
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,200
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

1147
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:51,770
How long were you wandering
outside the walls for?

1148
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:54,350
About 60 years.

1149
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:58,970
It was like... I was stuck in
a nightmare that would never  end.

1150
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,750
A light?

1151
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,870
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!

1152
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,100
It's the light that appears
when a Titan transforms!

1153
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,570
Then we're just in time.

1154
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:15,670
Soldiers, disperse!

1155
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,320
We believe the enemy has already transformed!

1156
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,320
Locate Eren and recover him!

1157
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,120
Another one of the Military Police!

1158
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,670
Battle is not our objective!

1159
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:38,690
Prioritize recovery and retreat!

1160
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,500
Phil! Round up the horses!

1161
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,750
Yes, Sir!

1162
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:49,450
First thing is to find the enemy
and let the others know!

1163
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,450
They should be fleeing from the forest!

1164
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,300
Break!

1165
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,420
Eren.

1166
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,520
Where are you?!

1167
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:02,970
Is that the scream of a Titan?

1168
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,220
It came from ahead!

1169
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,700
You can't hide from me!

1170
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,170
Wait!

1171
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,620
This is Ymir!

1172
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,850
She's the one they took! In Titan form!

1173
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:21,550
Where's Eren?!
What about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!

1174
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:26,020
So that's Ymir?

1175
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:28,470
Did she turn into a Titan
and fight with Reiner?!

1176
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:32,120
Did you get away from Reiner?!
Where are they?!

1177
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,620
Tell us anything, Ymir!

1178
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,820
Say something already!

1179
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,350
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!

1180
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,270
Something's not right.

1181
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,420
Ymir!

1182
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,720
Thank goodness!

1183
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,970
You're all right!

1184
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:53,020
Huh?

1185
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,020
No...

1186
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,970
She...

1187
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,600
She ate Christa!

1188
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:07,400
Don't just stand there! Chase her!

1189
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:14,020
She's fast! We're losing her!

1190
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,570
Why would Ymir do that?!

1191
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:19,750
I can't be the only one who could've
guessed it would turn out this way!

1192
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,470
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!

1193
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:27,070
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!
She lured us right in!

1194
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:30,220
Here she comes, Reiner.

1195
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,450
Right.

1196
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,950
All squads! Let the Titans chase after you!

1197
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,850
Follow my lead!

1198
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,370
Erwin...

1199
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:09,920
You demon! Are you trying
to use us as bait again?!

1200
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,400
Eren's being taken away!

1201
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,900
Don't stop!

1202
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:16,550
Get on your horse and chase!

1203
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,800
He's not fast enough to
escape! We'll catch up!

1204
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:32,350
This time, I won't hesitate.
I'll kill them both, I swear!

1205
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:36,600
No matter what it takes... I will!

1206
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,020
Christa!

1207
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,100
Ymir...

1208
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,250
Ymir!

1209
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,270
Chris--

1210
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:22,920
No... Historia.
Sorry... for eating you... like that.

1211
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:27,270
I bet... you're mad at me.

1212
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,550
Ymir...

1213
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,120
What is this? What are you doing?

1214
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,520
We came here to rescue you and Er--

1215
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,720
I don't need rescuing!

1216
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,370
Just stay right there.

1217
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:43,150
I'm following Reiner and Bertholdt now.

1218
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:45,150
You, too. Come with me.

1219
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:50,170
There's no future within the walls!

1220
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,100
Listen to me, Historia...

1221
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:59,320
Outside the walls isn't as bad as you think.

1222
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:03,070
Especially... because there
won't be anyone saying that

1223
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:05,100
you're better off not being born.

1224
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,020
I'm pretty sure Titans won't be
saying that to me...

1225
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,970
...because they'll be too
busy trying to eat me!

1226
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,200
Everyone has at least one or two faults!

1227
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,370
If you can just overlook that,
they're not so bad after all!

1228
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:23,970
Ymir! Everything you're saying
and doing isn't making any sense!

1229
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:29,770
Could it be... that Reiner and
Bertholdt threatened you?

1230
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,470
Am I right, Ymir?!

1231
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,350
I'll fight them with you,
so let me out of your hand!

1232
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,550
I don't care if there's something
you can't tell me.

1233
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:43,250
No matter what happens...

1234
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:46,170
...I will always be your ally!

1235
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,070
Reiner! Protect us!

1236
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,120
I knew it! I'll have to kill Ymir first!

1237
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,520
Wait, Mikasa!

1238
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,620
Don't kill Ymir!

1239
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,570
That all depends on Ymir!

1240
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:57,050
What will it be? I'll kill everyone
that gets in my way, so choose!

1241
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:57,950
No, wait!

1242
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:01,820
Ymir will be killed unless she does
what Reiner and Bertholdt say!

1243
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,820
She doesn't have a choice!

1244
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:08,270
There's only so many lives
that I actually care about.

1245
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:12,650
My enemies made
deciding that easy six years ago.

1246
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,800
So... you're mistaken to seek
any compassion from me.

1247
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:22,470
Because right now, I'm all out of time
and room in my heart to care.

1248
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:27,420
Christa... do you pick
Eren or Ymir? Which is it?

1249
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,500
Will you get in my way, too?!

1250
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:32,200
Stop, Ymir!

1251
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,400
Don't fight back! You'll die!

1252
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,570
Don't move!

1253
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,320
Quit it, Eren!

1254
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,850
Don't struggle!

1255
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,370
Good luck with that, Bertholdt.

1256
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,720
It's impossible to get him to calm down.

1257
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,520
He's the most irritating guy there is!

1258
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,070
I know better than anyone!

1259
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,970
I hate him as much as you do.

1260
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:02,420
Hey... You're kidding, right?

1261
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:06,470
This whole time...
you kept quiet and deceived us?

1262
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:08,170
That's so cruel!

1263
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:10,870
You guys! Tell us it's all a lie!

1264
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,100
Bertholdt! Give him back!

1265
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:21,570
Hey, hey, hey...
You think you can just keep running away?

1266
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:23,750
That's not gonna happen!

1267
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,570
For three years, didn't we
sleep under the same roof

1268
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:30,000
as comrades through thick and thin?

1269
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,900
But you...

1270
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:36,770
To think you, the invader...
could sleep like a log...

1271
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:39,320
...right next your victims!

1272
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,420
Remember we talked
about surviving this together?

1273
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:46,620
And that we'd grow old, and someday
we'd all go out for drinks together?

1274
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:50,000
Was everything... all a lie?

1275
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,970
Was it?!

1276
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,770
You guys...

1277
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,720
What were you guys thinking this whole time?

1278
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,050
What's it even matter anymore?

1279
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:00,520
Just focus on cutting open his neck.

1280
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:03,350
They are enemies of humanity.

1281
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:05,100
That's all there is to know.

1282
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,170
--If you hesitate for a moment,
we won't be able to get Eren back.

1283
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:08,400
--T-Tell me who!
--If you hesitate for a moment,
we won't be able to get Eren back.

1284
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:08,820
--T-Tell me who!

1285
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:12,770
Who the hell would want to kill people
by their own choice?!

1286
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,420
Who the hell would like
doing this sort of thing?!

1287
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:23,200
Do you think I wanted to do this?!

1288
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,120
People hate and despise us...

1289
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,400
We've done such terrible things,
we deserve to die.

1290
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:32,100
Things we'll never be able to take back...

1291
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:39,800
But... we just... couldn't
come to terms with our sins.

1292
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:45,320
The only time we had some respite...
was when we pretended to be soldiers.

1293
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,800
That's not a lie!

1294
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:52,900
Conny! Jean! It's true we may have
deceived everyone, but it's not all a lie!

1295
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,370
We really considered you comrades!

1296
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,750
Neither of us have any
right to even apologize.

1297
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:04,700
But... someone...

1298
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,770
Please...

1299
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,220
Someone, please...

1300
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,120
Someone find us!

1301
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,420
Bertholdt...

1302
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,050
Give Eren back.

1303
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,250
It's no use... I can't.

1304
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,770
Someone has to be the one to do it.

1305
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:34,020
Someone has to be the one
to stain their hands with blood.

1306
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,020
You guys!

1307
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,420
Get away from there!

1308
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,070
I can't believe him...

1309
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:43,250
What the hell is that Erwin thinking?

1310
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:47,220
He's leading a horde of Titans this way!

1311
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:59,370
You guys! Jump and get outta there!

1312
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,620
All soldiers, disperse!

1313
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,620
Get far away from the Titans!

1314
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,700
Historia!

1315
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:37,750
What's going on?

1316
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,500
Is this hell?

1317
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,000
No... but it will be!

1318
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,000
All soldiers, charge!

1319
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:50,000
The fate of humanity will be determined
in this very moment!

1320
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:56,970
There is no future where humanity
can inhabit these lands without Eren!

1321
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:59,750
We recover Eren and immediately retreat!

1322
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,520
Give your hearts!

1323
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:05,850
Mikasa!

1324
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:17,020
What's happening out there?

1325
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,520
What the hell's going on?

1326
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,400
I can't move...

1327
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:28,750
Unless I tear these Titans off me,
it'll only get worse.

1328
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:31,650
In that case...

1329
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:34,550
Brace yourself, Bertholdt!

1330
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,920
A little more...

1331
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,990
Just a little more!

1332
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,970
It worked!

1333
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:42,200
His hand's gone!

1334
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,250
Now's our chance!

1335
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:46,100
Hey, Mikasa?! Can't you
see all those Titans?!

1336
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,100
Advance!

1337
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,800
Commander Erwin!

1338
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,620
Advance!

1339
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,750
Eren is just ahead!

1340
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,800
Advance!

1341
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,320
Right!

1342
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,390
Mikasa!

1343
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,970
You piece of shit!

1344
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:45,940
Let her go!

1345
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,400
Shit... This is all because I got caught.

1346
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,000
Everyone's gonna die because of me.

1347
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,550
Bertholdt!

1348
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,900
Armin?!

1349
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,570
What is it?

1350
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:09,020
What do I have to abandon?

1351
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,620
Is it my life?

1352
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,050
Or something else?

1353
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:31,500
Are you two okay with this?

1354
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,750
Leaving behind your comrade
and returning home?

1355
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:40,800
You're abandoning Annie?

1356
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,620
You know where she's at?

1357
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:47,750
Far north, deep underground in
the Utopia District... and being tortured.

1358
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:52,250
It was her screams that taught us something.

1359
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:57,670
That even with her body's healing,
you can never get rid of the pain.

1360
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,570
They're taking special care
to ensure she doesn't die.

1361
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:07,480
And as we speak,
they're not giving her body any rest.

1362
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,740
They're torturing her
every way they know how.

1363
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,940
You spawn of the devil!

1364
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,940
I'll pulverize you!

1365
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:39,600
All soldiers, retreat!

1366
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:53,150
Damn that Reiner!

1367
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:55,660
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

1368
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,770
Eren! Mikasa!

1369
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,530
Eren...

1370
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,020
Eren!

1371
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,550
Hannes!

1372
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:06,970
What are the odds of this?!

1373
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,720
Check it out, you two!

1374
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,770
You just watch.

1375
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:15,240
I'm about to avenge your mother
and butcher the shit out of this!

1376
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:20,550
Hannes!

1377
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:22,750
Give the old man backup!

1378
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:33,200
Don't get in our way, you big sack of shit!

1379
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,530
I did it.

1380
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,480
My first kill.

1381
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:55,600
Are you all right, Christa?!

1382
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,460
Conny, that's wrong.

1383
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:01,020
My name is Historia.

1384
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:03,510
Hey, Ymir...

1385
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:06,440
It's strange, really...

1386
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,440
When I'm with you,
no matter how screwed up it gets...

1387
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,440
...I'm not afraid!

1388
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:20,330
Shit!

1389
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,240
Don't, Mikasa! You're injured!

1390
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:37,420
Untie my hands!

1391
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:37,860
Hands?

1392
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,330
Hurry up!

1393
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,950
I've gotta be the one to do it!

1394
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:45,480
Who said I was done with you?!

1395
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,510
That one's... mine!

1396
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:50,550
Eren!

1397
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:54,020
Wait! We're trying to get you out of here!

1398
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,970
It's time to settle the score!

1399
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:57,970
Just watch!

1400
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,550
Huh?!

1401
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,080
Commander!

1402
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,130
The Armored one is coming!

1403
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,000
Jean!

1404
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:27,400
Jean!

1405
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:30,080
Are you okay?!

1406
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,080
Hold it together!

1407
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:40,400
Shit!

1408
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:43,480
What's wrong?!

1409
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:47,910
Eren!

1410
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,730
Right now...

1411
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:17,220
...I've gotta become a Titan...

1412
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:21,400
...or it's all for nothing!

1413
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,550
Eren...

1414
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:07,880
Nothing changed!

1415
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:11,060
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!

1416
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:15,220
You're still as useless as you ever were!

1417
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:19,240
Nothing changed!

1418
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:31,220
Mom...

1419
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:34,200
I... can't...

1420
01:46:35,110 --> 01:46:38,820
I still... can't do anything at all.

1421
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,840
Eren...

1422
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,200
That's not true.

1423
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:10,840
Eren...

1424
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,510
Listen...

1425
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,000
...I need to tell you something.

1426
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:25,260
You've always... been at my side.

1427
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:27,260
Thank you.

1428
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,620
You showed me... how to live with purpose.

1429
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:38,420
Thank you.

1430
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,260
And you...

1431
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:51,400
You wrapped this scarf around me.

1432
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:52,480
Thank you.

1433
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:17,240
I'll wrap that around you...

1434
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:19,970
as many times as you want.

1435
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,200
Now and forever... As much as you want!

1436
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,880
Why... are they...?

1437
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:32,110
They're eating it?

1438
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,480
Dunno what's going on, but now's our chance!

1439
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,970
Let's hurry and run!

1440
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:42,660
Right!

1441
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,170
So that's how it is...

1442
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:48,460
That's why Reiner was so desperate for Eren.

1443
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:51,940
Which means, even inside the walls...

1444
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,940
...there's a future.

1445
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:00,150
This is the worst...

1446
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:02,680
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into

1447
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,570
the hands of the worst person imaginable?

1448
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:07,930
We've gotta get it to us...

1449
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:11,440
I can say... without a doubt...

1450
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,370
...the one person in the world
I wouldn't want to have it...

1451
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:17,380
...is you, Eren!

1452
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:19,770
Get away from me!

1453
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:24,020
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

1454
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,480
Not good! Bertholdt!

1455
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,550
I can't protect Bertholdt like this!

1456
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,660
What? The Titans?

1457
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,640
Eren!

1458
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:44,060
Get on!

1459
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:44,930
Armin!

1460
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,840
Hurry!

1461
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:49,910
Don't let this chance escape!

1462
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:51,600
Full retreat!

1463
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,060
Ymir!

1464
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:05,200
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?!
We're heading back!

1465
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:18,480
I sorry...

1466
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,070
Huh?

1467
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,330
Ymir! Where are you going?!

1468
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,020
Leave her!

1469
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,260
But Ymir is--

1470
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:57,840
In that moment, I couldn't understand
the motivation behind Ymir's actions...

1471
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:02,710
...but the Armored Titan
didn't pursue us any further.

1472
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,150
Ymir...

1473
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,570
Why did you come to us?

1474
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,970
Oh, well...

1475
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:28,950
If you hadn't come to bust up this wall...

1476
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:33,180
...I would've never woken up
from that nightmare.

1477
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,720
All I'm doing...

1478
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:39,810
...is returning what I borrowed back then.

1479
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,170
And...

1480
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:50,840
It wasn't so bad, you know...
being a goddess for a while.

1481
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,040
This is just our theory...

1482
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:05,300
The fact that the Titans ignored us
and ran towards Reiner...

1483
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:11,150
We think it was because of you.

1484
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,400
It's a tough spot to be in, Eren.

1485
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,480
Whether or not all those
people died for nothing...

1486
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,680
...it all depends on you.

1487
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,110
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1488
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:31,660
I've gotta do this.

1489
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,420
I'll control the Titans.

1490
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:35,660
I'll plug up Wall Maria.

1491
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:39,540
I'll capture Reiner and make him pay.

1492
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:44,500
That's what I've gotta do
to atone for all those lives lost.

1493
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,880
Say again?

1494
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:53,260
The Titans responsible for this incident...
were the citizens of Ragako?

1495
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:58,350
In other words, the true
identity of Titans...

1496
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:00,510
...is humans?

1497
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,910
So... you're telling me...

1498
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:08,070
...I've spent all this time and energy

1499
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:12,060
running around killing people?

1500
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:13,330
Is that right?

1501
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:17,460
We don't... have proof yet.

1502
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:22,310
Erwin.

1503
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,970
Hey. Tell me.

1504
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:30,420
The hell you smiling for?

1505
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,860
It's nothing.

1506
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,970
It's just...

1507
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:44,970
...with this, we've taken
one more step towards the truth.

1508
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,660
Just one step, huh?

1509
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:52,400
We'll run out of people
before we learn the truth.

1510
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,110
It's not worth the cost.

1511
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,130
But it is a step towards the truth.

1512
01:54:58,330 --> 01:55:01,240
One day, we'll break it down.

1513
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,420
This wall hiding the truth...

1514
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:07,240
...will fall.

1515
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:13,550
Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk

1516
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:16,860
on some pure white sand,

1517
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:20,240
gaze at the horizon

1518
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,560
without living in fear?

1519
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:27,460
Wouldn't it be sweet to watch the sun curve

1520
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:30,860
down mid the waves

1521
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:34,150
and taste the ocean spray

1522
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:38,880
and realize we've been living

1523
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,060
as slaves?

1524
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:45,330
We've got to learn to get back, get back

1525
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:48,730
but is it worth the price of our soul?

1526
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:52,570
You know you had to kill her, kill her!

1527
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:55,820
Oh my dirty hands, it never fades

1528
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:58,750
And if we get out, get out

1529
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:02,040
I'll think about the price of our soul

1530
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:05,370
We've got to learn to live free, live free

1531
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:09,350
We'll live a life without barricades

1532
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:04,200
How long I haven't seen the light shine
through in my life?

1533
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,460
Lost everything, family

1534
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,620
Confusion on the way

1535
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:13,750
Someone tries to talk to me
and signpost the righteous road

1536
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:15,970
My animal inside

1537
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:19,340
can now be tamed to go over

1538
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,370
the wall

1539
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:23,750
We've got to learn to get back, get back

1540
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:26,000
but is it worth the price of our soul?

1541
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,620
You know you had to kill her, kill her!

1542
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,930
Oh my dirty hands, it never fades

1543
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:32,930
And if we get out, get out

1544
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:35,150
I'll think about the price of our soul

1545
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:37,400
We've got to learn to live free, live free

1546
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,400
We'll live a life without barricades

1547
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:26,130
Sasha, I'll get Captain Levi chop you up
if you sneak some food out.

1548
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:28,910
I won't. Probably...

1549
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,200
Say what?

1550
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,660
Hey! Did you guys wipe the dust and dirt
from your shoes properly before coming in?

1551
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,370
Huh?

1552
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:38,590
No, we didn't. Can't you see
all the stuff we're carrying?

1553
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:42,800
Do you seriously think that attitude
will satisfy Captain Levi?

1554
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,040
If I hadn't made your bed this morn--

1555
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:49,400
Quit nagging! Who are you, my mom?!

1556
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,840
We're back.

1557
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,220
Wait, were you chopping firewood?

1558
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:54,750
My body's getting dull.

1559
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:57,770
You got grabbed by a Titan!
You shouldn't be moving yet!

1560
01:58:57,770 --> 01:59:01,880
I tried to stop her, but she won't listen.
I saw her doing sit-ups earlier.

1561
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,220
How dare you, you peeping Tom!

1562
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:04,740
Huh?

1563
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,570
--Mikasa, you <i>do</i> know you're not
a wild animal, right?

1564
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:07,800
--How does that constitute "peeping"?!
--Mikasa, you <i>do</i> know you're not
a wild animal, right?

1565
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:12,000
It's almost like we're back in the Cadet Corps.

1566
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,480
Yeah...

1567
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,710
Why do you think we were chosen
for the new Levi Squad, though?

1568
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:21,600
Protecting Eren and Historia
is more than an important mission.

1569
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,750
Because we're talented, I assume.

1570
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:28,170
What did you just put in your bag?

1571
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,570
Nothing bread-related.

1572
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:32,470
Why you!

1573
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:33,510
Give it back.

1574
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:37,400
Hey, focus! We gotta finish cleaning
before the Captain gets back!

1575
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,130
Put back the bread.

1576
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,400
--How many times have you done this now?
--What's this commotion about?

1577
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,480
Our food expenses are precious!

1578
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:46,770
Cut the crap, Potato Girl!

1579
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:57,800
You should have had plenty of time...

1580
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:16,570
Ackerman? Is that his last name?

1581
02:00:17,370 --> 02:00:21,150
I lived with him for a while when I was a kid.

1582
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:26,320
Kenny!

1583
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:35,200
"Starts July 2018!"
